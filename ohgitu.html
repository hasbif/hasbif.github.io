                <h2>OHGITU Debut Mixtape Out Now!</h2>
                <p>    

                    This mixtape was created as a reminder for fellow OHGITU member, MoPrblms, of his second home, Sugar Land, Texas, after he moved to his home country. The group was very affected by the move and decided that making music together was a way to connect with each other across the world. The tape contains elements of hip-hop, rap, pop, boy-band music, etc to present the group's diverse taste in music packed into one mixtape. This tape is a huge milestone for the group by having an idea come to life, where the thought of creating music seemed unfeasible and unimaginable until now. Thank you so much for reading and hope you guys enjoy the tape. We definitely enjoyed making it and hopefully we can convey that to our listeners :)
